Hello!, Iâ€™m Mainul, a Site Reliability Engineer focused on building dependable, scalable systems and simplifying complex cloud operations.

Currently, I work at [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/) on the **Reliability/Platform Engineering** team, helping to implement and maintain cloud-native SaaS solutions for fast, scalable, and resilient infrastructure. Previously, I worked in the **Strategic Support Solutions** team within Technical Support Services, optimizing customer Azure environments and developing automation to reduce operational toil.

I studied Computer Science at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/). I work across **Microsoft Azure** and **AWS**, containerize with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, and manage infrastructure as code. I primarily script in **Python**, with **Bash** and **Ruby** as needed.

Here are a few areas I focus on:
- **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Extensive work with Microsoft Azure and AWS environments
- **Automation & DevOps**: Developing CI/CD pipelines, containerized workflows, and automation scripts
- **Incident Response**: Managing high-pressure support environments and incident management
- **API Development**: Building Python-based automation processes and cost-saving initiatives
- **System Administration**: Windows Server, SQL Server, IIS, and Linux-based systems

Outside of work, I explore **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **AI** solutions, with hands-on projects in cybersecurity and reliability infrastructure automation. I value cross-team collaboration, adaptability, and operational excellence across cloud and hybrid environments.

You can find my automation and infrastructure projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mainulhossain123), including tools for Pingdom monitoring, Cloudflare API integrations, and .NET Core diagnostics.
